ms17-010

Microsoft Windows Windows 7/8.1/2008 R2/2012 R2/2016 R2 - 'EternalBlue' SMB Remote Code Execution (MS17-010)

This script is from https://github.com/pythonone/MS17-010/blob/master/scanners/smb_ms17_010.py.
Regards!

I spare little effort to modify it to a batch script for personal use!

That's it!

##  Sample

you just need to provide ip list in with file such as ip.txt.

starnight:ms starnight$ python smb_ms17_010_batch.py ip.txt
